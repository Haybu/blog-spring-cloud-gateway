<p>One of the imperative architectural concerns is to protect APIs and service endpoints from harmful effects, such as denial of service, cascading failure. or overuse of resources. Rate limiting is a technique to control the rate by which an API or a service is consumed. In a distributed system, no better option exists than to centralize configuring and managing the rate at which consumers can interact with APIs. Only those requests within a defined rate would make it to the API. Any more would raise an HTTP “Many requests” error.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG) is a simple and light weight component, yet it is an effective way to manage limiting API consumption rates. In this blog, I am going to illustrate how simply that can be accomplished by using a configuration method. As illustrated in the figure below, the demonstration consists of a frontend and backend services with a Spring Cloud Gateway service in between.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock thumb">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No code whatsoever is needed to include the SCG in the architecture. You need to include a Spring Boot Cloud dependency (org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-gateway) in a vanilla Spring Boot application, and you’re set to go with the appropriate configuration settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Requests received by SCG from a frontend service can be routed to a backend service based on a configured route definition. A route definition configuration specifies to the gateway how a request should be routed to a backend endpoint. A route configuration usually defines conditions based on information that can be extracted from HTTP requests, such as paths and headers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the snippet below lists a YAML stanza to configure the condition under which requests should be routed to a backend service. It shows that requests should target the backend service when the gateway is hit with “/backend” in the path.  In the configuration, the route is given an identifier and the backend service URI.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: route1
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/backend</code></pre>

<p>RequestRateLimiter is one of the many gateway filters offered by SCG. The implementation determines whether a request is allowed to proceed or has exceeded its limit. The implementation lets you (optionally) plug in a key to manage limiting the number of requests to different services. While it is customizable to implement how to resolve a key, the gateway comes with one that uses a user’s Principal name. A secured gateway is needed to resolve a user’s principal name, but you have the option to implement the KeyResolver interface to instead resolve a different key from the ServerWebExchange. You can point to a custom KeyResolver bean (for example, named customKeyResolver) in the configuration by using a SPEL #{@customKeyResolver} expression. The following listing shows the KeyResolver interface:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">KeyResolver interface</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public interface KeyResolver {
    Mono&lt;String&gt; resolve(ServerWebExchange exchange);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gateway would deny requests if no key was resolved. To let the gateway accept a missing resolved key, you can set the following property:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-properties" data-lang="properties">spring.cloud.gateway.filter.request-rate-limiter.deny-empty-key=false</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also specify a status code that the gateway should report when it could not figure out a key by setting the following property:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-properties" data-lang="properties">spring.cloud.gateway.filter.request-rate-limiter.empty-key-status-code=</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider a blueprint architecture in which a gateway controls limiting API consumptions by using Redis. The provided Redis implementation uses the Token Bucket algorithm. To use it, you need to include the spring-boot-starter-data-redis Spring Boot starter dependency in the gateway application. Basically, the token bucket algorithm uses balance tokens as a means to maintain an accumulating budget of utilization. The algorithm assumes a bucket adds tokens at a certain rate and that calls to the API consume those tokens. One API invocation may perform many operations to compose a response in order to fulfill a request (think of GraphQL-based APIs). In such cases, the algorithm helps to recognize that one invocation may cost an API more than one token.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The provided Redis implementation lets you define the request rate at which users can make calls within a certain time period. It also makes it possible to accommodate sporadic demands while constrained by the defined consumption rate. For example, a configuration can define a replenish rate of 500 requests per second by setting the redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate = 500 property and a burst capacity of 1000 request per second by setting the redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity property. Doing so limits consumption to 500 requests every second. If a burst in the number of requests occurs, only 1,000 requests are allowed. However, because 1,000 requests are a quota of 2 seconds, the gateway would not route requests for the next second. The configuration also lets you define how many tokens a request would cost by setting the property redis-rate-limiter.requestedTokens property. Typically, it is set to 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use a gateway with a request limiting feature, it needs to be configured with the RequestRateLimiter gateway filter. The configuration can specify arguments to define a replenish rate, burst capacity, and the number of tokens that a request costs. The example below illustrates how to configure a gateway with these arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: route1
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/backend
          filters:
          - name: RequestRateLimiter
            args:
              redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 500
              redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 1000
              redis-rate-limiter.requestedTokens: 1</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring cloud gateway provides the flexibility to define your own custom rate limiter implementation. It offers a RateLimiter interface to implement and define a bean. The rate limiter bean can be configured by using a SPEL expression, as in the case of a custom key resolver. For instance, you can define a custom rate limiter bean named customRateLimiter and a custom key resolver named customKeyResolver and configure a route like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">@Bean
public KeyResolver customKeyResolver {
	return exchange -&gt; ....  // returns a Mono of String
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: route1
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/backend
          filters:
          - name: RequestRateLimiter
            args:
              rate-limiter: "#{customRateLimiter}"
              key-resolver: "#{customKeyResolver}"</code></pre>
